MongoDB: A cross-platform document database

MongoDB is a NoSQL (non-relational) document-oriented database.

While conventional relational databases have a typical schema design based on columns and tables, MongoDB is schema-less. Data is stored in flexible documents with a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)-based query language. The content, size, and number of fields in the documents can differ from one to the next. This means that the data structure to be changed over time.

MongoDB is known for being flexible and easy to scale.

Express: A back-end web application framework, like "Ruby on Rails , PHP or Django"

Express is web application framework for Node.js.

Instead of writing full web server code by hand on Node.js directly, developers use Express to simplify the task of writing server code. There’s no need to repeat the same code over and over, as you would with the Node.js HTTP module.

The Express framework is designed for building robust web applications and APIs. It’s known for its fast speed and minimalist structure, with many features available as plugins.

React:  A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

The React library can be used for creating views rendered in HTML. React views are declarative. This means that developers don’t have to worry about managing the effects of changes in the view’s state (the object that determines how components behave) or changes in the data.

Node.js: A cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment

Node.js was initially built for Google Chrome, and later open-sourced by Google in 2008. It is built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. It’s designed to build scalable network applications, and can execute JavaScript code outside of a browser.

Node.js works without an enclosing HTML page, instead using its own module system based on CommonJS, to put together multiple JavaScript files.



Difference between: The parenthesis are returning a single value, the curly braces are executing multiple lines of code.

const foo = (params) => (
    <span>
        <p>Content</p>
    </span>
);
vs.

const handleBar = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    dispatch('logout');
};
